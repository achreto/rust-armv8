# Rust ARMv8 (aarch64/aarch32)

Rust library to program ARMv8-A hardware. It provides access and construction functions
for ARMv8 hardware-defined state and data structures.

## Acknowledgements

The library closely follows the structure of [rust-x86](https://github.com/gz/rust-x86),
and borrows some of its code.
